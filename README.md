## Installation
To get started, clone the repository and set up your Python virtual environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/crypto-news-generator.git
cd crypto-news-generator
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Setup
Ensure you have the necessary API keys from Alchemy and OpenAI. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your keys:

```plaintext
OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY
ALCHEMY_API_KEY=YOUR_ALCHEMY_API_KEY
```

## Usage
To fetch blockchain data and generate reports, you need to run the `data_analyzer.py` and `report_generator.py` scripts.

### Analyzing Blockchain Data

Run the following command to analyze blockchain data:

```bash
python data_analyzer.py
```

### Generating Report

Run the following command to generate a report based on the analyzed blockchain data:

```bash
python report_generator.py
```

## API Keys
You will need two API keys for this project:

- **Alchemy API Key:** To fetch blockchain data.
- **OpenAI API Key:** To generate insightful reports using GPT-3.5.

Add these keys to your `.env` file as shown in the [Setup](#setup) section.

## Generating Reports
The report generation process involves two main steps:

### Fetching and Analyzing Blockchain Data
The `data_analyzer.py` script fetches the latest blockchain data using the Alchemy API and analyzes it to extract meaningful information.

### Generating Insights Using OpenAI and Langchain
The `report_generator.py` script uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5 API and Langchain to generate a detailed report based on the analysis. Langchain helps in managing and chaining together the language model prompts and outputs efficiently.
